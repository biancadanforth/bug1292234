# bug_1542035

Mercurial patch for fixing [Bug 1542035](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1542035) in Firefox

This work initially started as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/biancadanforth/fb6aaae07084512a594a8098c971807e) targeting the [meta bug 1292234](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1542035), but as this work is adding new functionality to a Firefox feature, it is complicated enough to benefit from using issue tracking and the like.
